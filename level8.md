## level 8 

first step was to create a new bucket in gce

than to create a new service account with the proper permissions
such as storage admin
than we need to create a new key for the service account
and save it on our local machine
that key will be used to auth inside our python code 


## steps
considering we have the key.json file, created a bucket and the service account
create venv
install google cloud storage and other dep
create a requirements.txt file
first create env and logger
than write the actual writing python code
which is really simple
important to differ between blob and bucket
blob is the file itself
bucket is the bucket (yeah i know)
